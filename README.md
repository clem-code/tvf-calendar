<h1>TVF Task</h1>

A few quick reflections on this task:

* After looking through some React calendar libraries and playing about with them, I decided to try and build the calendar programmatically which was a good test of my basic JavaScript and React skills!
* I've been learning Chakra for a side-project, so I thought I would use it here. Honestly, this was probably a bit of a mistake as I couldn't get up to speed on using the flexbox functionality or some of the state for things I wanted to add in as extras (like modals).
* I haven't done much SQL and I didn't have the time to get a backend up and running so I used local storage to save calendar dates. This worked in the end and was a good test of my fundamental JavaScript.

Overall, I felt I underperformed on this project, largely because I lost a lot of time looking at React Calendar libraries and then another chunk trying to figure out Chakra. Whilst what I produced in the end wasn't my best work and doesn't look great, I was pleased to be able to get something working and I was happy with some of the code I wrote to work around some of the issues I came across along the way.
